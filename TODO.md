# CIEL Development Roadmap

## Phase 0: Basic System Setup
- [ ] Set up macOS power management system (sleep, low-power mode settings)
- [ ] Install essential system utilities (e.g., homebrew, osascript)
- [ ] Configure system to restart on crash or failure
- [ ] Set up osascripting for macOS automation
- [ ] Install and configure logging system
- [ ] Configure log file rotation for cleanup
- [ ] Set up a monitoring system to track CPU, memory, and disk usage
- [ ] Create basic system health check scripts
- [ ] Automate system startup and service recovery scripts
- [ ] Test system uptime and service restart functionality

## Phase 1: File Management Setup
- [ ] Create directory structure for file management (incoming, processed, archived)
- [ ] Set up storage devices and format as needed (external drives, cloud volumes)
- [ ] Mount storage devices and configure access permissions
- [ ] Write script to monitor `incoming/` folder for new files
- [ ] Set up basic file processing logic (renaming, tagging files)
- [ ] Create file queue for incoming files for processing
- [ ] Implement logic to move processed files to appropriate directories (processed/archived)
- [ ] Test file watcher and movement logic
- [ ] Set up error logging for failed file processing

## Phase 2: Context System Setup
- [ ] Define basic context structure (tags, categories, metadata)
- [ ] Set up a method to attach context to incoming files and store in logs
- [ ] Create script to extract context (e.g., metadata, file type, keywords)
- [ ] Develop system to track file relationships (context-based)
- [ ] Test context tracking with sample files
- [ ] Write context-aware querying system for accessing metadata and tags

## Phase 3: Agent Setup
- [ ] Design agent structure for task execution
- [ ] Write agent logic to interface with file system and context system
- [ ] Integrate basic agent decision-making logic (based on context and inputs)
- [ ] Create agent action logs to track executed tasks
- [ ] Set up agent error handling and retries
- [ ] Test agent actions (e.g., running file processing tasks)
- [ ] Write configuration scripts for agent settings (e.g., task frequency, conditions)

## Phase 4: Long-Term Memory Setup
- [ ] Define long-term memory structure (e.g., file archives, knowledge base)
- [ ] Set up method to store context and actions taken by the agent over time
- [ ] Implement search functionality to query long-term memory (e.g., file history, decisions)
- [ ] Create backup system for long-term memory data
- [ ] Implement version control for memory data (incremental updates)
- [ ] Test memory querying and retrieval

## Phase 5: Orchestration and Automation
- [ ] Create a system to orchestrate file management, agent, and memory tasks
- [ ] Set up job scheduling and orchestration tools for workflow automation
- [ ] Integrate task dependencies and order of operations (e.g., file processing, memory update)
- [ ] Write automation scripts to trigger agent actions based on file system events
- [ ] Set up error handling and retry mechanisms for orchestration failures
- [ ] Test entire orchestration flow (from file detection to context storage)

## Phase 6: Final Testing and Optimization
- [ ] Test entire system flow end-to-end (file management → context system → agent → memory)
- [ ] Optimize performance for file processing, agent decision-making, and memory access
- [ ] Monitor system resource usage under load (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- [ ] Test recovery mechanisms after service crashes or interruptions
- [ ] Conduct performance profiling and optimize slow tasks
- [ ] Ensure proper logging and monitoring integration throughout all services
